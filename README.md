# Hybrid-TDOA-Multi-Calib
In this paper, to enhance calibration accuracy, we propose to incorporate the time difference of arrival measurements between adjacent sound events (TDOA-S) with respect to the microphone arrays. More specifically, we propose a two-stage approach including an initial value estimation (IVE) procedure and the final joint optimization step. The VLE stage initializes all parameters except for microphone orientations using hybrid TDOA (i.e., TDOA-M and TDOA-S), odometer data from a moving robot carrying a speaker, and DOA and refines the microphone orientations. The final joint optimization step estimates multiple microphone array locations, orientations, time offsets, clock drift rates, and sound source locations simultaneously. Both simulation and experiment results show that for scenarios with moderate TDOA noise levels, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.
